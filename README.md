# Using Machine Learning to Predict Diabetes Mellitus Based on Risk Factors

Group Members: Youxia Zhao, Peter Tran

Background: 
It's projected that the global diabetic population will reach 642 million by 2040, affecting approximately one in every ten adults. This alarming statistic necessitates significant attention. Aside from an unhealthy Body Mass Index (BMI), diabetes has various other risk factors. High blood pressure, high cholesterol, physical inactivity, and smoking, as outlined in a CDC article, contribute to the complexity of diabetes. To enhance diabetes diagnosis accuracy, it's crucial to thoroughly examine these influential risk factors.

Objective: 
Our motivation is to utilize risk factors for diabetes to build a predictive model that can quantify if considering risk factors is beneficial for more accurate diabetes diagnosis. Specifically, we will incorporate the risk factors of high blood pressure and high cholesterol into the learning of our model. We hope to explore if adding a particular one of these risk factors, both, or none contribute to a more accurate diabetes diagnosis.
